## Hello there, My name is Min Lee ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer with experience in Front-end development and AWS. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to address real-world issues. Iâ€™m currently serving for ROKA(Republic of Korea Army).

In my spare time, I enjoy researching front-end frameworks and how they can be used to build better user experiences. I also enjoy reading books on software development and personal growth. Some of my favourites are The Pragmatic Programmer and Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software.

I graduated with a diploma in Computer Systems Technology from BCIT in 2020, concentrating in Web Development and Cloud Computing. I gained extensive practical experience through various projects.

Other things I enjoy (in no particular order): bass guitar, skateboarding, Manchester United, lego, and bible study.
